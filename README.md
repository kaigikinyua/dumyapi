## Dummy Data Language (DDL)

The DDL is a simple language that enables you to generate random data from a json like syntax.
Since most developers have json syntax at their fingertips it is much easy to use and it offers more flexibility than the generic data provided.

### General Syntax

* {'dummy_username':username} - Enables you to get an object which has a key by 'dummy_username' and the value of a username. Note username without single quotes is a ddl variable

* {'dummy_product_list':[ 'name':productName,'price':int...10]}. This will return an array of 10 objects{'name':'pname','price':100} and the key of this array will be 'dummy_product_list'

* {'dummy_users':[ username...10]}. The response for this will be a list of usernames whose key is 'dummy_user'
