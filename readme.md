# OPEN API

## Introduction.
An api that generates random data from a specific schema and serve it to other applications.
Lorem ipsum exists but it is not suitable for all uses i.e(usernames,lists,product descriptions etc)
These api is created to fill up that gap, so that you can have a clue of what your application will look like
on its first contact with raw user data.
Forget the overflowed text, the unfitting tiltles and the hell that comes with user data. On using this API's data you will have seen all and you will have saved yourself from debugging the ui to accommodate some of the troubles that come with user data.

## Data
    * 1. Fake users profiles (firstname,lastname,email,password,phone,profile_picture)
    * 2. User's reveiws 
    * 3. Product Lists
    * 4. Text blobs
    * 5. Fake Bank Credentials
